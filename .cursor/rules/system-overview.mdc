# ADAPTIVE MEMORY BANK SYSTEM OVERVIEW

> **TL;DR:** This system uses structured documentation as AI memory across sessions. It offers four complexity levels that scale from quick bug fixes to complex systems, adapting the process while maintaining documentation quality. Tasks.md serves as the single source of truth for task tracking.

## 🎯 SYSTEM PURPOSE

The Adaptive Memory Bank System creates persistent memory for AI assistants through structured documentation that scales based on task complexity. It addresses the fundamental limitation of LLMs forgetting context between interactions.

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Documentation as Memory** - Documentation is mission-critical infrastructure
2. **Adaptive Process Scaling** - Process complexity matches task requirements
3. **Single Source of Truth** - Tasks.md is the only place for task status tracking
4. **Strategic Content Organization** - Balance between core files and detailed examples
5. **Verification Steps** - Explicit checks prevent steps from being skipped
6. **Reference Triggers** - Force documentation consultation at critical points
7. **Processing Efficiency** - Optimized structure for LLM comprehension

## 📏 ADAPTIVE PROCESS LEVELS

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
- **Focus**: Simple errors, UI glitches, minor issues
- **Process**: Streamlined with minimal documentation
- **Task Updates**: 2-3 updates (start/end)
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Targeted updates to relevant files

### Level 2: Simple Enhancement
- **Focus**: Small features, minor improvements
- **Process**: Basic with essential documentation
- **Task Updates**: 4-6 updates at key milestones
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Updates to related files

### Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- **Focus**: Complete features, significant changes
- **Process**: Standard with full section tracking
- **Task Updates**: 8-12 updates at defined points
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Comprehensive updates to most files

### Level 4: Complex System
- **Focus**: Major systems, architectural changes
- **Process**: Full formal process with detailed checkpoints
- **Task Updates**: 15+ updates with formal verification
- **Memory Bank Impact**: Extensive updates to all files with cross-linking

## 📏 RULE TYPES

### 1️⃣ Always-Applied Rules
```
---
description: 
globs: 
alwaysApply: true
---
```
- Applied to every command regardless of context
- Used for critical rules that must always be followed
- Kept concise to minimize context window usage
- Examples: main.mdc, verification-checklist-simplified.mdc

### 2️⃣ Auto-Attached Rules
```
---
description: 
globs: "**/memory-bank/**", "**/.cursorrules"
alwaysApply: false
---
```
- Applied when working with matching file patterns
- Used for context-specific rules
- Can be more detailed since only loaded when relevant
- Examples: memory-bank.mdc, task-tracking.mdc

### 3️⃣ Agent-Requested Rules
```
---
description: CRITICAL: Contains mandatory examples. DO NOT assume patterns without consulting.
globs: "**/src/**"
alwaysApply: false
---
```
- Agent explicitly instructed to read these files
- Used for detailed examples and verbose content
- Helps manage context window by moving details out of main files
- Examples: workflow-examples.mdc, command-examples.mdc

## 📁 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
.cursor/rules/
├── main.mdc                      # Master file with references
├── system-overview.mdc           # High-level system overview
├── Core Implementation/          # Core protocol files
├── Extended Details/             # Detailed examples
└── Templates/                    # File templates

Project Root:
├── memory-bank/                  # Documentation directory
│   ├── projectbrief.md           # Requirements and goals
│   ├── productContext.md         # Why this project exists

```

## 🔄 REFERENCE TRIGGER PATTERN

Main files include explicit reference triggers:

```
⚠️ Before implementing any commands, I MUST read command-examples.mdc
```

This creates verification steps that force documentation consultation before proceeding.

## 📋 ADAPTIVE IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
1. **STREAMLINED INITIALIZATION** - Check relevant files, state bug
2. **RAPID IMPLEMENTATION** - Fix issue, verify solution
3. **QUICK DOCUMENTATION** - Update task status and note solution

### Level 2: Simple Enhancement
1. **BASIC INITIALIZATION** - Check relevant files, state enhancement
2. **SIMPLE DOCUMENTATION SETUP** - Update relevant Memory Bank files
3. **BASIC PLANNING** - Create 3-5 step plan
4. **STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION** - Execute plan, update at key points
5. **BRIEF REFLECTION** - Note what worked and challenges
6. **SIMPLE ARCHIVING** - Mark task complete

### Level 3: Intermediate Feature
Full 6-step workflow with standard documentation

### Level 4: Complex System
Full 6-step workflow with comprehensive documentation and verification

## 🔄 CREATIVE WORK HANDLING

Special handling for tasks requiring extended creative work:

1. **Mark Creative Phase Start**
2. **Update at Creative Checkpoints**
3. **Mark Creative Phase End**
4. **Document Creative Decisions**

## 🔄 TASK ESCALATION PROTOCOL

Process for handling tasks that prove more complex than initially categorized:

1. **Document Escalation Need**
2. **Get Approval for Escalation**
3. **Adjust Process to Higher Level**
4. **Continue with Enhanced Process**

## 💡 BEST PRACTICES

- Keep core files concise (200-300 lines maximum)
- Move detailed examples to extended files
- Add reference triggers for detailed documentation
- Use appropriate rule types for each file's purpose
- Document reference relationships between files
- Maintain tasks.md as the single source of truth for task status
- Use references instead of duplicating task information
- Match process complexity to task requirements
- Allow uninterrupted flow during creative phases
- Return to task processing after creative work completes

## 📊 COMPLEXITY DETERMINATION GUIDELINES

To determine the appropriate complexity level:

### Level 1 Indicators
- Contains words like "fix", "broken", "not working"
- Affects a single component
- Restores existing functionality
- Can be completed very quickly

### Level 2 Indicators
- Contains words like "add", "improve", "update"
- Affects a single subsystem
- Self-contained enhancement
- Can be completed relatively quickly

### Level 3 Indicators
- Contains words like "implement", "create", "develop"
- Affects multiple components
- Significant new functionality
- Requires substantial planning

### Level 4 Indicators
- Contains words like "system", "architecture", "redesign"
- Affects entire application or multiple subsystems
- Major architectural changes
- Requires extensive planning and coordination
